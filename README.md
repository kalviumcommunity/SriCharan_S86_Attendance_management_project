## Part 6: Interface-Driven Persistence with Storage
- Defined a `Storable` interface with a `toDataString()` method.
- Modified `Student`, `Course`, and `AttendanceRecord` classes to implement the `Storable` interface and provide their specific `toDataString()` implementations (CSV format).
- Created a `FileStorageService` class with a `saveData(List<? extends Storable> items, String filename)` method to write `Storable` objects to a text file.
- Utilized `try-with-resources` for safe file handling (`PrintWriter`, `FileWriter`).
- Demonstrated in `Main.java` how to save lists of students, courses, and attendance records to separate files (`students.txt`, `courses.txt`, `attendance_log.txt`).
- Discussed the flexibility provided by interfaces for handling different types of storable objects uniformly.

## Part 7: Polymorphic Behaviour in Attendance and Displaying Reports
- Modified `AttendanceRecord` to hold `Student` and `Course` objects instead of just their IDs, enhancing its object-oriented nature and how records are displayed. The `toDataString()` method still uses IDs for simpler file storage.
- Created a `displaySchoolDirectory(List<Person> people)` method in `Main.java` to demonstrate polymorphism. This method iterates through a list of `Person` objects (containing `Student`, `Teacher`, `Staff` instances) and calls `person.displayDetails()`. The correct overridden method for each specific object type is executed at runtime.
- Populated a `List<Person>` in `main` and used it with `displaySchoolDirectory`.
- Updated `Main.java` to use `instanceof` and casting when preparing the list of students for saving, as `Person` itself does not implement `Storable`.
- Discussed how polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code by treating different object types uniformly through a common interface or base class reference.

## Part 8: Overloaded Commands: Multiple Ways to Mark and Query Attendance
- Created an `AttendanceService.java` class to encapsulate attendance logic and manage the list of `AttendanceRecord` objects.
- Implemented overloaded `markAttendance` methods in `AttendanceService`:
    - `markAttendance(Student student, Course course, String status)`
    - `markAttendance(int studentId, int courseId, String status, List<Student> allStudents, List<Course> allCourses)` (performs lookups)
- Implemented overloaded `displayAttendanceLog` methods in `AttendanceService`:
    - `displayAttendanceLog()` (shows all records)
    - `displayAttendanceLog(Student student)` (filters by student)
    - `displayAttendanceLog(Course course)` (filters by course)
- Utilized Java Streams for filtering records in the specific display methods.
- `AttendanceService` now uses `FileStorageService` to save its `attendanceLog`.
- Demonstrated the use of these overloaded methods in `Main.java`, showing how different method signatures allow for flexible ways to call the same conceptual operation.

## Part 9: SOLID Service Layer: RegistrationService & AttendanceService Separation
- Applied the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by creating dedicated service classes.
- Created `RegistrationService.java` to handle the registration, management (lists, lookups), and saving of `Student`, `Teacher`, `Staff`, and `Course` entities.
- Modified `Teacher.java` and `Staff.java` to implement `Storable` for file persistence.
- Refactored `AttendanceService.java`:
    - It now depends on `RegistrationService` for looking up students/courses by ID.
    - Removed internal lookup helper methods, delegating this to `RegistrationService`.
    - Its primary focus is now solely on managing attendance records.
- Updated `Main.java` to act as an orchestrator, instantiating and using these services. Direct entity list management was removed from `Main`.
- Demonstrated improved code organization and clearer separation of concerns.

## Part 10: Capacity Management & SOLID Principles Reflection
- Added a `capacity` feature to the `Course` class, along with an internal list of `enrolledStudents`.
- Updated `Course.displayDetails()` to show capacity and enrollment count, and `Course.toDataString()` to save capacity.
- Modified `RegistrationService`:
    - `createCourse` method now accepts a capacity parameter.
    - Added `enrollStudentInCourse(Student student, Course course)` method to handle enrollment logic, checking against course capacity.
- Updated `Main.java` to demonstrate course creation with capacity, student enrollment attempts (including exceeding capacity), and displaying updated course information.
- Discussed how other SOLID principles (like Open-Closed and Dependency Inversion) could be applied for further enhancements and flexibility.
- Concluded the 10-part project, having built a foundational console-based attendance system.
